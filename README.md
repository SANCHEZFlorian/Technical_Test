The technical test was to create a CRUD on the subject of real estate.

I need to have a page for :

- see the real estate ad with the information of :
  - reference
  - price
  - living space
  - number of rooms
  - agent name
  - agent first name
- Modify an ad
- Create an ad
- delete an ad

And I had a multiples informations to describe table fields in base, and for the relation between each table.

It was my first project with Laravel, and the first project with a framework PHP too.
I'd never work a lot with PHP before, because I was just exit my formation for being a web developer, and I specialized with React. So in one week, I learn the base of Laravel, and described how I did the technical test.

The stack was :

- Laravel 8
- What I want for the front
