# Web app for search an artist as well as music and albums
For this job interview, I had 1 week for develop a webapp link to Spotify. I had just 4 constraints :
- Use Vue.js
- Use Spotify's API
- Use Credential Flow for authentication
- Commit the code to GitHub or GitLab


So, this is my code for this technical test ;)
