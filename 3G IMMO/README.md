# Technical Test for 3G IMMO

For this technical test, i need to build a CRUD for a property website.

It's a very hard challenge for me, because the constraint is to use Laravel, and **I never use a Framework of PHP**, just PHP Vanilla. So I have one week for learn and create this website.

This test need to have : 
- List of all estate ad with some information (reference, price, living space, number of piece, agent who have this ad)
- Creation of an estate ad
- Modification of an estate ad
- Deletion of an estate ad

I need to use : 
- Laravel 8 for back-end
- All I want for front-end

And, as a bonus, I can add a filter by price and/or living space.

So, let's do it !
