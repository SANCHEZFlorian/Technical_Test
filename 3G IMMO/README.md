# Technical Test for 3G IMMO

For this technical test, i need to build a CRUD for a property website.

It's a very hard challenge for me, because the constraint is to use Laravel, and **I never use a Framework of PHP**, just PHP Vanilla. So I have one week for learn and create this website.

This test need to have : 
- List of all estate ad with some information (reference, price, living space, number of piece, agent who have this ad)
- Creation of an estate ad
- Modification of an estate ad
- Deletion of an estate ad

I need to use : 
- Laravel 8 for back-end
- All I want for front-end

And, as a bonus, I can add a filter by price and/or living space.

So, let's do it ! 



# Resources and tools I used :
- GitHub for storage online my code and versionning
- Gitmind for build a visual view of User Story, Route and Data Base
- [Laragon](https://laragon.org/), for a configuration of my environment to Laravel
- YouTube for learn Laravel with video _(I used [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeeuvNW2FHVj4vHJRj9UDeDsXshHlnHJk) from [Nord Coders](https://www.youtube.com/c/NordCoders))_
- The official documentation of [Laravel](https://laragon.org/docs/)
- [Mocodo](http://www.mocodo.net/) for have an "official" visual of my data base



# The different stages of creation :
First, I receive the technical test the 23/08/2022, at, approximatly, 4pm.
If I say that, it's because I will write here what I did every day.
And second information : I was in training from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays, and with a part-time job _(21 hours a week)_ in the evenings _(usually from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m.)_ and weekends. So I did this project on my remaining time, as well as on a few hours of training _(I know, it's not good, but shh ;) )_. This information is just for say I don't work on this project 8 hours a day.

So, let's go ! ;)

### 23/08/2022 : Start to get some videos and documentation of Laravel
I found [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeeuvNW2FHVj4vHJRj9UDeDsXshHlnHJk) and start to watch this, the 2 first episod. 
I install Laragon for pre-built my environment. 
I'm on Windows for know.
I just test the system of view and route for print an "Hello World" first.

### 24/08/2022 : Start to write data base
This day, I start to write with my word and with GitMind the data base, the route and the user story. 
For the data base, it was _easy_ because there are only two table, the estate ad and the estate agent. 
There are two relation :
- one-to-one from estate ad to estate agent
- zero-to-many from estate agent to estate ad

So, it gives that _(one in english for you, and one une french because the project is for the french job)_ : 
![mcd english](img/mcd_EN.png)
![mcd fran√ßais](img/mcd_FR.png)

But I need to join the 2 tables with a foreign key, because just one agent is on the estate ad, but an agent can have a lot of estate ad. So I decide to contact my recruiter for have the approbation for create an over field on the table.
